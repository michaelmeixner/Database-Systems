Normal forms:
    1. no multivalued or composite attributes
    2. no attribute depends on part of a composite key (fix by getting rid of the composite key or assigning it to its own relation)
    3. no attribute is functionally dependent on a non-key attribute (fix by decomposing relation)
    most database designers ignore the following two, especially number 5
    4. all data in a relation is actually related to each other (fix by decomposing table)
    5. ?
