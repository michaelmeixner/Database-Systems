Entities:
    an entity in a database is basically an object in object oriented programming
    entities don't have behaviors, unlike objects which have both attributes and behaviors
    entities only have attributes
        attributes can be discrete or complex pieces of data
            if they are complex, they might be their own entity, and this is a relationship
    has-a and is-a relationships
        is-a example: class B extends class A
        has-a example: class A has attributes
ER Diagram
    entity-relationship diagram
    used to construct the database
    start with entities, then move on to relationships
Example:
    Giraffe Exhibit (GE) is our entity

        public class GE() {
            // following are attributes of the exhibit
            girrafe[] girrafes; //amount of girrafes in exhibit
            food
            water
            fence
            pillows[] pillows;
            liveStream
            lights
            sign
            ID
        }
    
    A properly diagrammed entity should have at least one attribute that uniquely identifies that entity (i.e. an ID number)
        called a key attribute
    Key attributes are essential to keeping the database running well
    Entities can have more than one key attribute

ORM - Object Relational Modeling:
    basically a library that takes your objects and breaks them down into their component bits to store in entity form in a database
    when you want an object, just ask it for certain key values and it will fetch the object
