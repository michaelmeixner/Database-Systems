stored procedures and functions:
    a transaction is a set of procedures to be done on a database
    ensures concurrency and no dirty reads

    transactions: procedures
    exception handling with try/catch: procedures
    call from select: functions
    DML (data manipulation language)(insert, update, delete, etc.): procedures (functions can only use select statement)
    return: functions always return, procedures *may* return

    procedures can call functions, but functions can't call procedures
    functions are meant to be simplistic
