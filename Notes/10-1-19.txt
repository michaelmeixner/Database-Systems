A relation can be an entity or a relationship in a database
    a relation is made up of attributes
        attributes are characteristics
            attributes must be atomic - cannot be subdivided
            "luckily", what makes something atomic is up to you
A foreign key is a key in a different relation
a domain is a set of valid values for an attribute
Tuple
    a tuple is a record within a relation (relation = group of attributes)
    all tuples have to be unique
