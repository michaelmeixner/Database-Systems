Still on ch. 5
We always envision a relation as a table
    attributes are first row of data - headers
    tuples are the rows of data

A state is the state of the database at any moment in time
    Once db is in valid state it's good to go
2 things we can do with db
    query:
        literally saying i have a question i want db to answer
        making statements out of boolean algebra to get an answer from the db

    modify:
        we can modify db by
            inserting new data
                adds a tuple (row of data) to a relation
            deleting existing data
                removes a tuple from a relation
            modifying data (called updating in MySQL)
                changing data in tuple, adding data to existing tuple, removing data from existing tuple

keep problems from occurring when modifying db with following methods
    transaction processing
        if we're going to do something, save the db state and try what you're about to do
            if bad things happen, undo what you just did
    cascade
        go ahead and do thing, and if it breaks, follow these rules
        might lose data this way
        a couple options when cascading
            delete tuple in which invalid data was found (can lose data this way)
            update invalid data field in that tuple with a null or default value

We do all these things in SQL (structured query language)
    multiple parts to this language
        DDL - data definition language
            builds relations
        DML - data manipulation language (what most people refer to when they say SQL)
            insert, update, delete, query
