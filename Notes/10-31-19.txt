Unstructured data:
    data that differs in quality
        different attributes, etc.
XML - extensible markup language 
tags in html don't tell us anything about the data they're formatting
tags in xml do - this means we can make our own tags
    files much bigger because they are text and not binary
relational databases give you information as an xml file
xml has additional rules that html doesn't follow:
    xml document has to be well-formed
        root element
        every open tag must be closed
        must be properly nested
        xHTML adopted this well-formed structure for html
    has to be valid
        means that the document is well-formed and complies with the DTD or schema
        #PCDATA - parsed-character data - type of schema
